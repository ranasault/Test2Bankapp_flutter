# test2_flutter

A new Flutter project. I done this coding by myself and i also use online sources like chatgpt to done my  work.
i updated the coding of main.dart file and pubspec.yaml file with the help of chatgpt.

My Rajputana Banking app is a simple mobile banking application that allows users to:
 View a welcome screen with a bank logo, a greeting message, and today's date.
 Navigate to an account list screen showing different bank accounts with balances.
 Select an account and view transaction details for that account.
 Navigate only in a controlled way:

Welcome → Account List → Transactions
Transactions → Account List → Welcome
Key Features
Dynamic JSON Parsing (Reads accounts & transactions from JSON files)
Simple & Clean UI (Uses ListView, Card, Text, and Icons)
Navigation Control (Users can move between screens in a structured way)
Date Formatting (Uses intl package for displaying dates)
